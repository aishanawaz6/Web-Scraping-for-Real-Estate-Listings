# Project: Web Scraping for Real Estate Listings

## Project Overview

I'm excited to share the successful completion of the "Web Scraping for Real Estate Listings" project to enhance the property search platform.

## Project Description

The goal of the project was to improve property search platform by incorporating data from various online real estate platforms. The solution involved building a sophisticated web scraper capable of collecting property listings from a popular real estate website, specifically scraping data from zameen.com.

## Project Tasks and Achievements

### 1. Data Collection

I successfully developed a robust web scraper using Python, utilizing libraries such as Beautiful Soup and Requests. This scraper efficiently extracted crucial property details such as location, price, number of bedrooms, and amenities from the target real estate website.

Data was scrapped from: https://www.zameen.com/

### 2. Data Cleaning

In the data cleaning phase, I meticulously handled missing values, ensuring data consistency, and preprocessed the scraped data to make it ready for analysis. This step was vital in delivering a high-quality dataset.

### 3. Data Storage

The cleaned data was stored in a structured format, opting for a CSV to maintain simplicity and ease of use. This strategic decision facilitated a seamless transition to the subsequent stages of the project.

### 4. Data Analysis

Performing exploratory data analysis provided valuable insights into the collected property data. This analysis laid the foundation for making informed decisions and addressing requirements effectively.

### 5. Deployment

The final deliverables showcased my commitment to excellence. I provided not only the scraped and cleaned dataset but also the meticulously crafted Python web scraper code.
